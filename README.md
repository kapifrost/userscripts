AniWatch Ad Blocker: [Install](https://github.com/kapifrost/userscripts/raw/main/AniWatch.to%20Popup%20Blocker%20(Release).user.js)

This one can block popup ads on AniWatch or HiAnime, whatever you call it now. Pop up ads don't open every 5 seconds with this userscript. Works on iOS Safari. Should not be affected by other ad blockers.
