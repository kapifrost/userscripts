AniWatch Ad Blocker: [Install](https://github.com/kapifrost/userscripts/raw/main/AniWatch.to%20Popup%20Blocker%20(Release).user.js)

This one can block popup ads on AniWatch or HiAnime, whatever you call it now. Pop up ads don't open every 5 seconds with this userscript. Works on iOS Safari. Should not be affected by other ad blockers.

***

Fmoviesz Ad Blocker: [Install](https://github.com/kapifrost/userscripts/raw/main/Fmoviesz.to%20Popup%20Blocker%20(Release).user.js)

This one can block popup ads on Fmoviesz. Also works on iOS Safari. Should not be affected by other ad blockers.

YouTube Ad Block Detect Bypass (ABP): [Install](https://github.com/kapifrost/userscripts/raw/main/YouTube%20Ad%20Block%20Detect%20Bypass%20(ABP).user.js)

**\*THIS REQUIRES AD BLOCKER TO WORK\***

Recently, AdBlockPlus hasn't been working for me on YouTube, so I created a fix for it.

This userscript tampers with this line of code, so that it thinks the ad is still visible even if it is hidden by AdBlockPlus
